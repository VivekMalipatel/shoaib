Okay, I will search for files related to date and time handling and analyze them for potential issues or inconsistencies.

Okay, I have analyzed the provided frontend code files for date and time handling. Here's a summary of the findings and potential issues:

**Core Helper Functions (`js/api-config.js`)**

1.  **`DEFAULT_TIMEZONE = 'America/Chicago'`**: Consistently defined.
2.  **`formatInChicagoTimezone(date, options)`**: Uses `toLocaleString` with the correct timezone. This seems appropriate for *displaying* dates and times to the user in the desired timezone.
3.  **`getChicagoDate(date = new Date())`**: This function is potentially problematic. It formats a date into a string using Chicago time and then parses it *back* into a `Date` object. The JavaScript `Date` object's internal value is always UTC. This conversion process can lead to unexpected results depending on the browser's local timezone settings during the parsing step. It aims to create a `Date` object whose *local* representation matches Chicago time, but it's not a robust way to handle timezones.

**HTML Files & JavaScript Logic**

1.  **`patient-dashboard.html`**:
    *   Uses `getChicagoDate` and `formatInChicagoTimezone` to display upcoming appointment dates/times.
    *   Correctly determines "Today" and "Tomorrow" based on Chicago dates derived from `getChicagoDate`.
    *   No major inconsistencies found here, but relies on the potentially flawed `getChicagoDate`.

2.  **`doctor-dashboard.html`**:
    *   Similar to patient-dashboard.html, uses helpers to fetch and display today's appointments in Chicago time.
    *   Relies on `getChicagoDate`.

3.  **`doctor-availability.html`**:
    *   **Calendar:** Uses `getChicagoDate` to determine "today" for highlighting and disabling past dates. This seems okay for date-level comparisons.
    *   **Time Slot Loading:** Fetches availability, compares specific dates (`a.date === formattedDate`) and falls back to `dayOfWeek`. This logic seems correct.
    *   **Time Slot Generation/Display:** Generates default 30-min slots. Uses `startTime`/`endTime` from fetched availability to mark slots.
    *   **Past Time Slot Disabling:** Uses an immediately-invoked function expression (IIFE) inside the `forEach` loop to compare the slot time (using `getChicagoDate` again) with the current Chicago time (`getChicagoDate()`). This logic is complex and potentially inefficient due to repeated `getChicagoDate` calls within the loop. It also relies heavily on `getChicagoDate` behaving as expected.
    *   **Saving Availability:** Calculates `startTime`/`endTime` based on selected slots. Sends `date` (YYYY-MM-DD), `dayOfWeek`, `startTime` (HH:MM), `endTime` (HH:MM), and `isAvailable` to the backend. This seems consistent within the file. Uses `toISOString().split('T')[0]` for the date format, which is standard.

4.  **`patient-find-doctors.html`**:
    *   **Date Loading:** Fetches availability, determines available dates for the next 30 days, considering specific date entries and day-of-week fallbacks. Uses `getChicagoDate` for "Today"/"Tomorrow" display formatting.
    *   **Time Slot Loading:** Generates slots based on availability start/end times. Fetches *booked* slots (`/api/doctor-slots/...`).
    *   **Past/Booked Slot Disabling:** Compares fetched booked times (extracted as HH:MM strings) with generated slot times. Checks for past slots by creating a `Date` object from the date string and slot time string (`new Date(${dateStr}T${slot.time}:00)`) and comparing it against `getChicagoDate()`. This mixing of direct `Date` creation (which uses the *browser's* timezone for interpretation unless an offset is provided) and `getChicagoDate` is inconsistent.
    *   **Booking:** Creates the `appointmentDateISO` string by hardcoding the timezone offset: `` `${year}-...T${hours}:...:00-05:00` ``. **This is a significant issue.** It assumes Chicago is always UTC-5 (CDT), which is incorrect during Standard Time (CST, UTC-6). This will lead to incorrect appointment times being saved during winter months.

5.  **`doctor-appointments.html`**:
    *   **Display:** Uses `getChicagoDate` and `formatInChicagoTimezone` for displaying appointment dates/times. Correctly determines "Today", "Tomorrow", "Yesterday".
    *   **Filtering:** Filters by status (`all`, `scheduled`, etc.) and date (`today`, `tomorrow`, `this-week`, `next-week`). The date filtering relies on string matching (`dateTime.includes('today')`), which is fragile and will break if formatting changes or for more complex date ranges.
    *   **Reschedule Modal:**
        *   Loads available dates similarly to patient-find-doctors.html.
        *   Loads time slots similarly, fetching availability and booked slots.
        *   **Past/Booked Slot Disabling:** Excludes the *current* appointment's time slot from being marked as booked. Uses similar potentially inconsistent logic as patient-find-doctors.html for checking past slots (mixing `new Date()` and `getChicagoDate`).
        *   **Submitting Reschedule:** Creates `localAppointmentDate` using `new Date(year, month - 1, day, hours, minutes, 0)` (uses browser's local time interpretation) and then sends `localAppointmentDate.toISOString()` to the backend. Sending UTC is generally safer than hardcoding an offset, but the backend *must* be aware it's receiving UTC and handle the conversion back to the intended Chicago time correctly, considering DST for that specific date.

6.  **`patient-appointments.html`**:
    *   **Display & Tabs:** Uses `getChicagoDate` to categorize appointments into Upcoming, Past, and Cancelled tabs. The logic correctly compares dates and times using `getChicagoDate`. Uses `formatInChicagoTimezone` for display.
    *   **Reschedule Modal:** Very similar logic to the reschedule modal in doctor-appointments.html.
        *   Loads available dates and time slots for the selected doctor.
        *   Uses the same potentially inconsistent logic for disabling past/booked slots.
        *   **Submitting Reschedule:** Also uses `localAppointmentDate.toISOString()` to send the new appointment time to the backend (UTC).

**Overall Summary of Potential Issues & Inconsistencies:**

1.  **`getChicagoDate()` Brittleness:** The reliance on `getChicagoDate()` throughout the codebase is a major concern. String formatting and re-parsing is not a reliable way to handle timezones in JavaScript.
2.  **Inconsistent ISO String Formatting:**
    *   patient-find-doctors.html hardcodes the `-05:00` offset, failing during CST.
    *   patient-appointments.html and doctor-appointments.html use `toISOString()` (UTC), which is better but requires careful handling on the backend to interpret the date correctly in the Chicago timezone, especially considering DST shifts.
3.  **Past Time Slot Logic:** The method for checking if a time slot is in the past is complex and mixes different ways of creating `Date` objects (`new Date(...)` vs. `getChicagoDate()`), potentially leading to inconsistencies.
4.  **Daylight Saving Time (DST):** The hardcoded offset explicitly ignores DST changes. While using `toISOString()` avoids this on the *frontend*, the backend logic becomes critical. The display logic using `toLocaleString` *does* handle DST correctly.
5.  **String-Based Filtering/Comparisons:** Filtering appointments by date using `includes('today')` is fragile. Comparing booked slots using string times (HH:MM) might be okay if the format is guaranteed, but numerical comparisons are generally safer.
6.  **Client Clock Reliance:** The entire system relies on the client's clock being reasonably accurate, even when attempting to normalize to Chicago time via `getChicagoDate`.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Replace `getChicagoDate`:** Use a robust date/time library (like `date-fns-tz`, `dayjs` with timezone plugins, or `Luxon`) to handle timezone conversions and comparisons reliably.
*   **Standardize Backend Communication:** Decide on a single format for sending dates/times to the backend. UTC (`toISOString()`) is generally recommended. Ensure the backend consistently interprets the UTC time correctly in the context of the Chicago timezone for the *specific date* involved (to account for DST).
*   **Simplify Past Slot Logic:** Use a date library to reliably compare the slot time (in Chicago time) with the current time (in Chicago time).
*   **Improve Filtering:** Implement date filtering using proper date comparisons provided by a library, not string matching.
*   **Server-Side Validation:** Always validate dates, times, and availability on the server-side as the client-side logic can be bypassed or manipulated.
